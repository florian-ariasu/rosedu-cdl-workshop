# Piece of Pie

It's simple: get the flag.

* **Hint 1**: That's some pretty weird `read()` call you use.
* **Hint 2**: You already have the bits you need in the executable.

Score: 50

## Vulnerability

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability.
Overwrite the return address with the address of the `system("/bin/sh")` call conveniently placed in the binary. End up calling `system("/bin/sh").` and then getting the flag.

## Exploit

Script in `./sol/exploit.py`

## Environment

64-bit, ASLR on, DEP on, stack guard off

## Deploy

Use a classical xinetd-based approach for deployment.
Place flag in `/home/ctf/flag` folder.
